The ROC Template provides the reporting instructions and template for QSAs to document PCI DSS assessments with the aim of ensuring a consistent level of reporting among assessors.\nUse of this ROC Template is mandatory for all PCI DSS v4.0 submissions.\nThe tables in this template may be modified to increase/decrease the number of rows or to change the column width. Additional appendices may be added if the assessor feels there is relevant information to be included that is not addressed in the current format. However, the assessor must not remove any details from the tables provided in this document. Personalization, such as the addition of company logos to the title page below, is acceptable.\nDo not delete any content from Part I or Part II of this document. The Instruction pages may be deleted; however, the assessor must follow these instructions while documenting the assessment. The addition of text or rows is acceptable, within reason, as noted above. Refer to the PCI DSS v4.x Report on Compliance Template - Frequently Asked Questions document on the PCI SSC website for further guidance.\nThe ROC is completed during PCI DSS assessments as part of an entity\u2019s validation process. The ROC provides details about the entity\u2019s environment and assessment methodology and documents the entity\u2019s assessment results for each PCI DSS requirement. A PCI DSS compliance assessment involves thorough testing and assessment activities, from which the assessor will generate evidence (assessment workpapers). These workpapers contain comprehensive records of the assessment activities, including observations, results of system testing, configuration data, file lists, interview notes, documentation excerpts, references, screenshots, and other evidence collected during the assessment. The ROC is effectively a summary of evidence derived from the assessor\u2019s workpapers to document how the assessor performed the validation activities and how the resultant findings were reached. At a high level, the ROC provides a comprehensive summary of testing activities performed and information collected during the assessment against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. The information contained in a ROC must provide enough information and coverage to support the designated assessment findings.\nROC Sections\nThe ROC includes the following sections and appendices:\nPart I: Assessment Overview\n\u2013 Section 1: Contact Information and Summary of Results\n\u2013 Section 2: Business Overview\n\u2013 Section 3: Description of Scope of Work and Approach Taken\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

The ROC Template includes tables with reporting instructions built-in to help assessors provide all required information throughout the document. Responses must be specific and focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage. Use of template language for descriptions is discouraged and details must be specifically relevant to the assessed entity.\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

At each sub-requirement there is a place to designate the result (\u201cAssessment Findings\u201d), which can be checked as appropriate. See the example format in Figure 1.\nRefer to the following table when considering which selection to make. Only one assessment finding may be selected at the sub-requirement level and reporting associated with that assessment finding must be consistent across all required documents, including the AOC.\nRefer to the PCI DSS v4.x Report on Compliance Template - Frequently Asked Questions document on the PCI SSC website for further guidance.\n3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following:\n\u2022 Coverage for all locations of stored account data.\n\u2022 Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization.

For example, if the Reporting Instruction was \u201cIf Yes, complete the following\u201d and the response was \u201cNo\u201d then the assessor would simply mark that section as Not Applicable or N/A and no further testing is required. to be Not Applicable. A requirement is applicable if any aspects of the requirement apply to the environment being assessed, and a Not Applicable designation in the Assessment Findings should not be used in this scenario. Note: Requirements and/or individual bullets within a requirement noted as a best practice until its effective date are considered Not Applicable until the future date has passed. While it is true that the requirement is likely not tested (hence the original instructions), it is not required to be tested until the future date has passed, and the requirement is therefore not of the testing that demonstrates the requirement is Not Applicable. applicable until that date. As such, a Not Applicable response to future-dated requirements is accurate, whereas a Not Tested response would imply there was not any consideration as to whether it could apply. Once the effective date has passed, responses to those requirements should be consistent with instructions for all requirements.\nAssessment\nIn Place\nNot Applicable\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved.\nDecember 2022 Page viii\n> Security e Standards Council\nAssessment When to Use This Assessment Finding Finding Not Tested The requirement (or any single aspect of the requirement) was not included for consideration in the assessment and was not tested in any way. (See \u201cWhat is the difference between Not Applicable and Not Tested?\u201d in the following section for examples of when this option should be used.) Note: Where Not Tested is used, the assessment is considered a Partial Assessment. Not in Place Some or all elements of the requirement have not been met, are in the process of being implemented, or require further testing before it will be known if they are In Place. This response is also used if a requirement cannot be met due to a legal restriction, meaning that meeting the requirement would contravene a local or regional law or regulation. The assessor must confirm that a statutory law or regulation exists that prohibits the requirement from being met. Note: Contractual obligations or legal advice are not legal restrictions. Using Figure 1 In Figure 1, the Assessment Finding at 1.1.1 is Not Tested if either 1.1.1.a or 1.1.1.b are concluded to be Not Tested. In Figure 1, the Assessment Finding at 1.1.1 is Not in Place if either 1.1.1.a or 1.1.1.b are concluded to be Not in Place. Required Reporting Describe why this requirement was excluded from the assessment. Describe how the testing and evidence demonstrates the requirement is Not in Place. If the requirement is Not in Place due to a legal restriction, the assessor must describe the statutory law or regulation that prohibits the requirement from being met.\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

All rights reserved.\nDecember 2022 Page x\n> Security e Standards Council\nWhat Is the Difference between Not Applicable and Not Tested?\nGenerally, when reporting on a requirement where a third-party service provider is responsible for the task(s), the response is minimally captured at each requirement in the \u201cDescribe why the assessment finding was selected\u201d section and the corresponding evidence is identified in the evidence section of the requirement. An acceptable response for an In Place finding for 1.1.1.a would be documented at the requirement and may be something like:\nAssessor verified this is the responsibility of Service Provider X, as verified through review of x/y contract (document). Assessor reviewed the AOC for Service Provider X, dated YYYY-MM-DD, and confirmed the service provider was found to be PCI DSS compliant against PCI DSS vX.X for all applicable requirements, and that it covers the scope of the services used by the assessed entity.\nThat response could vary, but what\u2019s important is that it is noted as In Place, and that there has been a level of testing by the assessor to support the conclusion that this responsibility is verified and that the responsible party has been tested against the requirement and found to be compliant.\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved.\nDecember 2022 Page xii\n> Security e Standards Council\nAssessment Approach Reporting Options\nThere are two main reporting options for the assessment approach for PCI DSS. It is possible for different aspects of a requirement to meet any combination of these approaches. For example, if there are several types of system components that apply to a certain requirement, system component X may be validated by using a compensating control, while system component Y may be validated by using the defined approach, and system component Z may be validated by using the customized approach. Therefore, it is important to document the aspects of the requirement where Compensating Controls and the Customized Approach are used.\nAssessment When to Use This Approach Using Figure 2 Approach Customized Approach Focuses on the Customized Approach Objective of each For \u201cValidation Method \u2013 Customized Approach\u201d PCI DSS Requirement (if applicable), allowing entities to implement controls to meet the requirement\u2019s stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that does not strictly follow the defined requirement.

Responses should be specific and relevant to the assessed entity. Details provided should focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage and should avoid generic templated language.\nAssessor responses generally fall into categories, such as the following:\nReporting Example Usage Description of Response Instruction Term Indicate Indicate whether the assessed entity is an issuer or The response would be either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as shown: supports issuing services. \u2610 Yes \u2610 No Note: The applicability of some reporting instructions may be dependent on the response of a previous reporting instruction.

  "1.3.3": "Requirements that are Not Applicable to an environment must be verified as such. Using the example of wireless and an organization that does not use wireless technology in any capacity, an assessor could select Not Applicable for Requirements 1.3.3, 2.3.1 - 2.3.3, and 4.2.1.2 after the assessor confirms through testing that there are no wireless technologies used in their CDE or that connect to their CDE. Once this has been confirmed, the assessor may select Not Applicable for those specific requirements, and the accompanying reporting must reflect the testing performed to confirm the Not Applicable status.\nIf a requirement is completely excluded from review without any consideration as to whether it could apply, the Not Tested option must be selected. Examples of situations where this could occur may include:\nAn organization may be asked by their acquirer or brand to validate a subset of requirements\u2014for example, using the prioritized approach to validate certain milestones.\nAn organization may want to validate a new security control that impacts only a subset of requirements\u2014for example, implementation of a new encryption method that requires assessment of PCI DSS Requirements 2, 3, and 4.\nA service provider organization might offer a service that covers only a limited number of PCI DSS requirements\u2014for example, a physical storage provider may want only to validate the physical security controls per PCI DSS Requirement 9 for their storage facility.\nIn these scenarios, the organization wants only to validate certain PCI DSS requirements, even though other requirements might also apply to their environment. The resulting AOC(s) must be clear in what was tested and not tested.\nItems marked as Not Applicable require that the assessor render an opinion that the item is not applicable; however, with Not Tested, the assessor is simply following the entity\u2019s instructions to not test something with no opinion needed from the assessor.\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

All rights reserved.\nDecember 2022 Page 463\nPcl Security e Standards Council\nAppendix B Compensating Controls\nCompensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and documented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with not meeting the requirement through implementation of other, or compensating, controls.\nCompensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:\n1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.\n2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see the Customized Approach Objective for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not have a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the Purpose in the Guidance column for that requirement.\n3. Be \u201cabove and beyond\u201d other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a compensating control.)\n4. When evaluating \u201cabove and beyond\u201d for compensating controls, consider the following:\nNote: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS assessment. The effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating control will not be effective in all environments.\na. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under review. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting cleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex passwords, etc.) to compensate for the lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review (passwords).\nb. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not required for the item under review.\nc. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is unable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available from a vendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting network access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS monitoring of all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface.\n5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement.\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved.\nDecember 2022 Page 464\n> Security e Standards Council\n6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past (for example, where the performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).\nThe assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.\nTo maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is complete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report on Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable report is submitted to the requesting organization.\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.
