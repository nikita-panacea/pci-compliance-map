Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement. \n2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that \nthe original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see the Customized \nApproach Objective for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not \nhave a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the Purpose in the Guidance column for that requirement.  \n3. Be  above and beyond  other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a \ncompensating control.) \n4. When evaluating  above and beyond  for compensating controls, consider the following: \nNote: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS assessment. The \neffectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is implemented, the surrounding \nsecurity controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating control will not be effective in all \nenvironments.  \na. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under \nreview. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting \ncleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex \npasswords, etc.) to compensate for the lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk \nof interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review \n(passwords). \nb. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not \nrequired for the item under review.  \nc. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is \nunable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available from a \nvendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting \nnetwork access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS monitoring \nof all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface. \n5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement. \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n  2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage 465 \n6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past \n(for example, where the performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).  \nThe assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each \ncompensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.  \nTo maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is \ncomplete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report \non Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable \nreport is submitted to the requesting organization. \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n  2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement s \nCustomized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for that \norganization. \nThe entity implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria: \n  \nDocument and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Template in \nAppendix E1 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. \n  \nPerform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all information \nspecified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in Appendix E2 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) \nRequirements and Testing Procedures. \n  \nPerform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tested, \nwhen testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix. \n  \nMonitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control. \n  \nProvide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its \nassessor. \nThe assessor performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria:  \n  \nReview the entity s controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customized \ncontrol(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements. \n  \nDerive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control. \n  \nTest each customized control to determine whether the entity s implementation 1) meets the requirement s Customized Approach \nObjective and 2) results in an  in place  finding for the requirement. \n  \nAt all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA is \ninvolved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist with \nthe assessment of that customized control.  \n  \nThe entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the \ncustomized approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the derived \ntesting the assessor will perform. \n  \nUse of the customized approach must be completed by a QSA or ISA and documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on \nCompliance (ROC) Template and following the instructions in the FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template available on the PCI \nSSC website.  \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n  2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage 468 \n  \nEntities that complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a customized approach; however, these entities may \nelect to have a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.  \n  \nThe use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment \nbrands and acquirers). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for \nexample, whether an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach.  \nNote: Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity to \ndetermine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement s Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to effectively \nimplement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls. \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n  2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.
