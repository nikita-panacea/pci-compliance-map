All rights reserved. \n \nPage vi \nROC Template Instructions \nThis document, the PCI DSS v4.0 Report on Compliance Template (“ROC Template”), is the mandatory template for Qualified Security \nAssessors (QSAs) completing a Report on Compliance (ROC) for assessments against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \n(PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. The ROC Template provides the reporting instructions and template for QSAs to document \nPCI DSS assessments with the aim of ensuring a consistent level of reporting among assessors.  \nUse of this ROC Template is mandatory for all PCI DSS v4.0 submissions. \nThe tables in this template may be modified to increase/decrease the number of rows or to change the column width. Additional appendices \nmay be added if the assessor feels there is relevant information to be included that is not addressed in the current format. However, the \nassessor must not remove any details from the tables provided in this document. Personalization, such as the addition of company logos to \nthe title page below, is acceptable. \nDo not delete any content from Part I or Part II of this document. The Instruction pages may be deleted; however, the assessor must follow \nthese instructions while documenting the assessment. The addition of text or rows is acceptable, within reason, as noted above. Refer to the \nPCI DSS v4.x Report on Compliance Template - Frequently Asked Questions document on the PCI SSC website for further guidance. \nThe ROC is completed during PCI DSS assessments as part of an entity’s validation process. The ROC provides details about the entity’s \nenvironment and assessment methodology and documents the entity’s assessment results for each PCI DSS requirement. A PCI DSS \ncompliance assessment involves thorough testing and assessment activities, from which the assessor will generate evidence (assessment \nworkpapers). These workpapers contain comprehensive records of the assessment activities, including observations, results of system testing, \nconfiguration data, file lists, interview notes, documentation excerpts, references, screenshots, and other evidence collected during the \nassessment. The ROC is effectively a summary of evidence derived from the assessor’s workpapers to document how the assessor \nperformed the validation activities and how the resultant findings were reached. At a high level, the ROC provides a comprehensive summary \nof testing activities performed and information collected during the assessment against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \n(PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. The information contained in a ROC must provide enough information and coverage to \nsupport the designated assessment findings. \nROC Sections \nThe ROC includes the following sections and appendices: \n \nPart I: Assessment Overview \n– \nSection 1: Contact Information and Summary of Results \n– \nSection 2: Business Overview \n– \nSection 3: Description of Scope of Work and Approach Taken \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

  "Part I must be thoroughly and accurately completed to provide proper context for the assessment findings in Part II. The ROC Template": "includes tables with reporting instructions built-in to help assessors provide all required information throughout the document. Responses must \nbe specific and focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage. Use of template language for descriptions is \ndiscouraged and details must be specifically relevant to the assessed entity. \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage viii \nAssessment Findings \nThere are four possible assessment findings: In Place, Not Applicable, Not Tested, and Not in Place. At each sub-requirement there is a place \nto designate the result (“Assessment Findings”), which can be checked as appropriate. See the example format in Figure 1. \nRefer to the following table when considering which selection to make. Only one assessment finding may be selected at the sub-requirement \nlevel and reporting associated with that assessment finding must be consistent across all required documents, including the AOC.  \nRefer to the PCI DSS v4.x Report on Compliance Template - Frequently Asked Questions document on the PCI SSC website for further \nguidance. \nAssessment \nFinding \nWhen to Use This Assessment Finding \nUsing Figure 1 \nRequired Reporting \nIn Place \nThe expected testing has been performed, and all \nelements of the requirement have been met. \nIn Figure 1, the Assessment Finding at 1.1.1 is In \nPlace if all report findings are In Place for 1.1.1.a and \n1.1.1.b or a combination of In Place and Not \nApplicable. \nDescribe how the testing \nand evidence \ndemonstrates the \nrequirement is In Place. \nNot Applicable \nThe requirement does not apply to the organization’s \nenvironment.  \nNot Applicable responses require reporting on testing \nperformed to confirm the Not Applicable status including a \ndetailed description explaining how it was determined that \nthe requirement does not apply.  \nNote that reporting instructions that start with “If Yes” or “If \nNo” do not require additional testing to confirm the Not \nApplicable status. For example, if the Reporting \nInstruction was “If Yes, complete the following” and the \nresponse was “No” then the assessor would simply mark \nthat section as Not Applicable or N/A and no further \ntesting is required. \nIn Figure 1, the Assessment Finding at 1.1.1 is Not \nApplicable if both 1.1.1.a and 1.1.1.b are concluded \nto be Not Applicable. A requirement is applicable if \nany aspects of the requirement apply to the \nenvironment being assessed, and a Not Applicable \ndesignation in the Assessment Findings should not \nbe used in this scenario. \nNote: Requirements and/or individual bullets within a \nrequirement noted as a best practice until its effective \ndate are considered Not Applicable until the future \ndate has passed. While it is true that the requirement \nis likely not tested (hence the original instructions), it \nis not required to be tested until the future date has \npassed, and the requirement is therefore not \napplicable until that date. As such, a Not Applicable \nresponse to future-dated requirements is accurate, \nwhereas a Not Tested response would imply there \nwas not any consideration as to whether it could \napply.  \nOnce the effective date has passed, responses to \nthose requirements should be consistent with \ninstructions for all requirements. \nDescribe the testing \nperformed and the results \nof the testing that \ndemonstrates the \nrequirement is Not \nApplicable. \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage ix \nAssessment \nFinding \nWhen to Use This Assessment Finding \nUsing Figure 1 \nRequired Reporting \nNot Tested \nThe requirement (or any single aspect of the requirement) \nwas not included for consideration in the assessment and \nwas not tested in any way. \n(See “What is the difference between Not Applicable and \nNot Tested?” in the following section for examples of \nwhen this option should be used.) \nNote: Where Not Tested is used, the assessment is \nconsidered a Partial Assessment. \nIn Figure 1, the Assessment Finding at 1.1.1 is Not \nTested if either 1.1.1.a or 1.1.1.b are concluded to be \nNot Tested. \nDescribe why this \nrequirement was excluded \nfrom the assessment. \nNot in Place \nSome or all elements of the requirement have not been \nmet, are in the process of being implemented, or require \nfurther testing before it will be known if they are In Place. \nThis response is also used if a requirement cannot be met \ndue to a legal restriction, meaning that meeting the \nrequirement would contravene a local or regional law or \nregulation. The assessor must confirm that a statutory law \nor regulation exists that prohibits the requirement from \nbeing met. \nNote: Contractual obligations or legal advice are not legal \nrestrictions. \nIn Figure 1, the Assessment Finding at 1.1.1 is Not in \nPlace if either 1.1.1.a or 1.1.1.b are concluded to be \nNot in Place. \nDescribe how the testing \nand evidence \ndemonstrates the \nrequirement is Not in \nPlace. \nIf the requirement is Not in \nPlace due to a legal \nrestriction, the assessor \nmust describe the \nstatutory law or regulation \nthat prohibits the \nrequirement from being \nmet. \n \n \n \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

All rights reserved. \n \nPage xi \nWhat Is the Difference between Not Applicable and Not Tested? \nRequirements that are Not Applicable to an environment must be verified as such. Using the example of wireless and an organization that \ndoes not use wireless technology in any capacity, an assessor could select Not Applicable for Requirements 1.3.3, 2.3.1 - 2.3.3, and 4.2.1.2 \nafter the assessor confirms through testing that there are no wireless technologies used in their CDE or that connect to their CDE. Once this \nhas been confirmed, the assessor may select Not Applicable for those specific requirements, and the accompanying reporting must reflect the \ntesting performed to confirm the Not Applicable status. \nIf a requirement is completely excluded from review without any consideration as to whether it could apply, the Not Tested option must be \nselected. Examples of situations where this could occur may include: \n \nAn organization may be asked by their acquirer or brand to validate a subset of requirements—for example, using the prioritized \napproach to validate certain milestones. \n \nAn organization may want to validate a new security control that impacts only a subset of requirements—for example, implementation of \na new encryption method that requires assessment of PCI DSS Requirements 2, 3, and 4. \n \nA service provider organization might offer a service that covers only a limited number of PCI DSS requirements—for example, a \nphysical storage provider may want only to validate the physical security controls per PCI DSS Requirement 9 for their storage facility. \nIn these scenarios, the organization wants only to validate certain PCI DSS requirements, even though other requirements might also apply to \ntheir environment. The resulting AOC(s) must be clear in what was tested and not tested.  \nItems marked as Not Applicable require that the assessor render an opinion that the item is not applicable; however, with Not Tested, the \nassessor is simply following the entity’s instructions to not test something with no opinion needed from the assessor. \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage xii \nDependence on Another Service Provider’s Compliance \nGenerally, when reporting on a requirement where a third-party service provider is responsible for the task(s), the response is minimally \ncaptured at each requirement in the “Describe why the assessment finding was selected” section and the corresponding evidence is identified \nin the evidence section of the requirement. An acceptable response for an In Place finding for 1.1.1.a would be documented at the \nrequirement and may be something like:  \nAssessor verified this is the responsibility of Service Provider X, as verified through review of x/y contract (document). Assessor \nreviewed the AOC for Service Provider X, dated YYYY-MM-DD, and confirmed the service provider was found to be PCI DSS compliant \nagainst PCI DSS vX.X for all applicable requirements, and that it covers the scope of the services used by the assessed entity. \nThat response could vary, but what’s important is that it is noted as In Place, and that there has been a level of testing by the assessor to \nsupport the conclusion that this responsibility is verified and that the responsible party has been tested against the requirement and found to \nbe compliant. \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage xiii \nAssessment Approach Reporting Options \nThere are two main reporting options for the assessment approach for PCI DSS. It is possible for different aspects of a requirement to meet \nany combination of these approaches. For example, if there are several types of system components that apply to a certain requirement, \nsystem component X may be validated by using a compensating control, while system component Y may be validated by using the defined \napproach, and system component Z may be validated by using the customized approach. Therefore, it is important to document the aspects of \nthe requirement where Compensating Controls and the Customized Approach are used. \nAssessment \nApproach \nWhen to Use This Approach \nUsing Figure 2 \nCustomized Approach \nFocuses on the Customized Approach Objective of each \nPCI DSS Requirement (if applicable), allowing entities to \nimplement controls to meet the requirement’s stated \nCustomized Approach Objective in a way that does not \nstrictly follow the defined requirement. The customized \napproach supports innovation in security practices, allowing \nentities greater flexibility to show how their current security \ncontrols meet PCI DSS requirements. \nRefer to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \n(PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures for the \nCustomized Approach Objective. \nNote: Compensating Controls are not an option for the \nCustomized Approach \nFor “Validation Method – Customized Approach” \n• \nIf the Customized Approach is not used, select “No” for \nCustomized Approach acknowledgement check box, and mark \nthe relevant reporting instruction as Not Applicable. \n• \nIf the Customized Approach is used, complete the following: \no \nSelect “Yes” for Customized Approach acknowledgement \ncheck box. \no \nIdentify the aspects of the requirement where the \nCustomized Approach was used. \no \nComplete the Customized Approach Template in \nAppendix E (not pictured). \nDefined Approach \nThe traditional method for implementing and validating PCI \nDSS and uses the Requirements and Testing Procedures \ndefined within the standard. The entity implements security \ncontrols to meet the stated requirements, and the assessor \nfollows the defined testing procedures to verify that the \nrequirement has been met. \nNote on using Compensating Control(s): As part of the \ndefined approach, entities that cannot meet a PCI DSS \nrequirement explicitly as stated due to a legitimate and \ndocumented technical or business constraint may \nimplement other or compensating controls that sufficiently \nmitigate the risk associated with the requirement. On an \nannual basis, any compensating controls must be \ndocumented by the entity and reviewed and validated by the \nassessor and included with the Report on Compliance \nsubmission. \nFor “Validation Method – Defined Approach” \n• \nIf Compensating Controls are not used, select “No” for \nCompensating Control acknowledgement check box, and mark \nthe relevant reporting instruction as Not Applicable. \n• \nIf Compensating Control(s) are used, complete the following:  \no \nSelect “Yes” for Compensating Control \nacknowledgement check box. \no \nIdentify the aspects of the requirement where a \ncompensating control(s) is used. \no \nComplete the Compensating Controls Worksheet in \nAppendix C (not pictured). \n \n \n\n \n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

Responses should be specific and relevant to \nthe assessed entity. Details provided should focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage and should avoid \ngeneric templated language.  \nAssessor responses generally fall into categories, such as the following: \nReporting \nInstruction Term \nExample Usage \nDescription of Response \nIndicate \nIndicate whether the assessed entity is an issuer or \nsupports issuing services.  \nThe response would be either “Yes” or “No” as shown: \n☐ Yes   ☐ No \nNote: The applicability of some reporting instructions may be dependent on the \nresponse of a previous reporting instruction. If applicable, the reporting instruction \nwill direct the assessor to a subsequent instruction based on the yes/no answer. \nIdentify \nIdentify the evidence reference number(s) from \nSection 6 for all documentation examined for this \ntesting procedure. \nThe response would include the relevant item(s) requested.  \nExample Reporting Instruction: “Identify the evidence reference number(s) from \nSection 6 for all documentation examined for this testing procedure.” \nExample Response: Doc-01  \nOR \nDoc-01 (Company XYZ Information Security Policy) \nNote: When a reference number is available, it is required; however, the \nassessor also has the option to list individual items in addition to the reference \nnumber. \nDescribe \nDescribe why the assessment finding was \nselected. \nThe response would include a detailed description of the item or activity in \nquestion — for example, details of how the evidence examined or individuals \ninterviewed demonstrate a requirement was met, or how the assessor concluded \na control implemented is fit-for-purpose.

All rights reserved. \n \nPage 464 \nAppendix B \nCompensating Controls \nCompensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and \ndocumented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with not meeting the requirement through \nimplementation of other, or compensating, controls.  \nCompensating controls must satisfy the following criteria: \n1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement. \n2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that \nthe original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see the Customized \nApproach Objective for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not \nhave a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the Purpose in the Guidance column for that requirement.  \n3. Be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a \ncompensating control.) \n4. When evaluating “above and beyond” for compensating controls, consider the following: \nNote: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS assessment. The \neffectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is implemented, the surrounding \nsecurity controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating control will not be effective in all \nenvironments.  \na. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under \nreview. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting \ncleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex \npasswords, etc.) to compensate for the lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk \nof interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review \n(passwords). \nb. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not \nrequired for the item under review.  \nc. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is \nunable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available from a \nvendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting \nnetwork access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS monitoring \nof all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface. \n5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement. \n\n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage 465 \n6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past \n(for example, where the performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).  \nThe assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each \ncompensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.  \nTo maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is \ncomplete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report \non Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable \nreport is submitted to the requesting organization. \n\n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

Note that \ncompensating controls must also be documented at the corresponding PCI DSS requirement in Part II Findings and Observations. \nNote: Only entities that have legitimate and documented technological or business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls \nto achieve compliance. \nRequired Number and Definition: <Enter Response Here> \n \nInformation Required \nExplanation \n1. Constraints \nDocument the legitimate technical or business constraints \nprecluding compliance with the original requirement. \n<Enter Response Here> \n2. Definition of Compensating \nControls \nDefine the compensating controls, explain how they address \nthe objectives of the original control and the increased risk, if \nany. \n<Enter Response Here> \n3. Objective \nDefine the objective of the original control (for example, the \nCustomized Approach Objective). \n<Enter Response Here> \nIdentify the objective met by the compensating control (note: \nthis can be, but is not required to be, the stated Customized \nApproach Objective for the PCI DSS requirement). \n<Enter Response Here> \n4.

The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement’s \nCustomized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for that \norganization. \nThe entity implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria: \n \nDocument and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Template in \nAppendix E1 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. \n \nPerform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all information \nspecified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in Appendix E2 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) \nRequirements and Testing Procedures. \n \nPerform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tested, \nwhen testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix. \n \nMonitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control. \n \nProvide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its \nassessor. \nThe assessor performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria:  \n \nReview the entity’s controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customized \ncontrol(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements. \n \nDerive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control. \n \nTest each customized control to determine whether the entity’s implementation 1) meets the requirement’s Customized Approach \nObjective and 2) results in an “in place” finding for the requirement. \n \nAt all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA is \ninvolved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist with \nthe assessment of that customized control.  \n \nThe entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the \ncustomized approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the derived \ntesting the assessor will perform. \n \nUse of the customized approach must be completed by a QSA or ISA and documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on \nCompliance (ROC) Template and following the instructions in the FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template available on the PCI \nSSC website.  \n\n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. \n \nPage 468 \n \nEntities that complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a customized approach; however, these entities may \nelect to have a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.  \n \nThe use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment \nbrands and acquirers). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for \nexample, whether an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach.  \nNote: Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity to \ndetermine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement’s Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to effectively \nimplement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls. \n\n \nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 \n \nDecember 2022 \n© 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.
