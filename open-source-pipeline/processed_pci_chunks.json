  "Assessment Findings": "in the",
  "What Is the Difference between Not Applicable and Not Tested?": "Requirements that are Not Applicable to an environment must be verified as such. Using the example of wireless and an organization that does not use wireless technology in any capacity, an assessor could select Not Applicable for Requirements 1.3.3, 2.3.1 - 2.3.3, and 4.2.1.2 after the assessor confirms through testing that there are no wireless technologies used in their CDE or that connect to their CDE. Once this has been confirmed, the assessor may select Not Applicable for those specific requirements, and the accompanying reporting must reflect the testing performed to confirm the Not Applicable status. If a requirement is completely excluded from review without any consideration as to whether it could apply, the Not Tested option must be selected. Examples of situations where this could occur may include:  An organization may be asked by their acquirer or brand to validate a subset of requirements-for example, using the prioritized approach to validate certain milestones.  An organization may want to validate a new security control that impacts only a subset of requirements-for example, implementation of a new encryption method that requires assessment of PCI DSS Requirements 2, 3, and 4.  A service provider organization might offer a service that covers only a limited number of PCI DSS requirements-for example, a physical storage provider may want only to validate the physical security controls per PCI DSS Requirement 9 for their storage facility. In these scenarios, the organization wants only to validate certain PCI DSS requirements, even though other requirements might also apply to their environment. The resulting AOC(s) must be clear in what was tested and not tested. Items marked as Not Applicable require that the assessor render an opinion that the item is not applicable; however, with Not Tested, the assessor is simply following the entity's instructions to not test something with no opinion needed from the assessor. PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1:",
  "Dependence on Another Service Provider's Compliance": "Generally, when reporting on a requirement where a third-party service provider is responsible for the task(s), the response is minimally captured at each requirement in the \"Describe why the assessment finding was selected\" section and the corresponding evidence is identified in the evidence section of the requirement. An acceptable response for an In Place finding for 1.1.1.a would be documented at the requirement and may be something like: Assessor verified this is the responsibility of Service Provider X, as verified through review of x/y contract (document). Assessor reviewed the AOC for Service Provider X, dated YYYY-MM-DD, and confirmed the service provider was found to be PCI DSS compliant against PCI DSS vX.X for all applicable requirements, and that it covers the scope of the services used by the assessed entity. That response could vary, but what's important is that it is noted as In Place, and that there has been a level of testing by the assessor to support the conclusion that this responsibility is verified and that the responsible party has been tested against the requirement and found to be compliant.

  "Understanding the Reporting Instructions": "The reporting instructions in the Reporting Template explain the intent of the response required. Responses should be specific and relevant to the assessed entity. Details provided should focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage and should avoid generic templated language. Assessor responses generally fall into categories, such as the following: Reporting Instruction Term Example Usage Description of Response Indicate Indicate whether the assessed entity is an issuer or supports issuing services. The response would be either \"Yes\" or \"No\" as shown: ☐ Yes ☐ No Note: The applicability of some reporting instructions may be dependent on the response of a previous reporting instruction. If applicable, the reporting instruction will direct the assessor to a subsequent instruction based on the yes/no answer. Identify Identify the evidence reference number(s) from Section 6 for all documentation examined for this testing procedure. The response would include the relevant item(s) requested. Example Reporting Instruction: \"Identify the evidence reference number(s) from Section 6 for all documentation examined for this testing procedure.\" Example Response: Doc-01 OR Doc-01 (Company XYZ Information Security Policy) Note: When a reference number is available, it is required; however, the assessor also has the option to list individual items in addition to the reference number. Describe Describe why the assessment finding was selected. The response would include a detailed description of the item or activity in question - for example, details of how the evidence examined or individuals interviewed demonstrate a requirement was met, or how the assessor concluded a control implemented is fit-for-purpose. The response should be of sufficient detail to provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the item or activity being described. Attest Identify the name of the QSA who attests. The assessor's name is simply provided in the response. This \"signature\" adds more weight than a simple \"yes\" or \"checkmark\" response and is used when no additional reporting is needed.

  "Appendix B Compensating Controls": "Compensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and documented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with not meeting the requirement through implementation of other, or compensating, controls. Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria: 1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement. 2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see the Customized Approach Objective for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not have a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the Purpose in the Guidance column for that requirement. 3. Be \"above and beyond\" other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a compensating control.) 4. When evaluating \"above and beyond\" for compensating controls, consider the following: Note: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS assessment. The effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating control will not be effective in all environments. a. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under review. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting cleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex passwords, etc.) to compensate for the lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review (passwords). b. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not required for the item under review. c. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is unable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available from a vendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting network access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS monitoring of all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface. 5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement. PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 December 2022 © 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 465 6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past (for example, where the performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed). The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above. To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is complete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report on Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable report is submitted to the requesting organization.

  "Appendix C Compensating Controls Worksheet": "Use this worksheet to document any instance where a compensating control is used to meet a PCI DSS defined requirement. Note that compensating controls must also be documented at the corresponding PCI DSS requirement in",
  "Appendix D Customized Approach": "This approach is intended for entities that decide to meet a PCI DSS requirement's stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that does not strictly follow the defined requirement. The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement's Customized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for that organization. The entity implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria:  Document and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Template in Appendix E1 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures.  Perform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all information specified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in Appendix E2 of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures.  Perform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tested, when testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix.  Monitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control.  Provide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its assessor. The assessor performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria:  Review the entity's controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customized control(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements.  Derive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control.  Test each customized control to determine whether the entity's implementation 1) meets the requirement's Customized Approach Objective and 2) results in an \"in place\" finding for the requirement.  At all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA is involved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist with the assessment of that customized control.  The entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the customized approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the derived testing the assessor will perform.  Use of the customized approach must be completed by a QSA or ISA and documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on Compliance (ROC) Template and following the instructions in the FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template available on the PCI SSC website. PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1 December 2022 © 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 468  Entities that complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a customized approach; however, these entities may elect to have a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.  The use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for example, whether an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach. Note: Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity to determine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement's Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to effectively implement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls.
