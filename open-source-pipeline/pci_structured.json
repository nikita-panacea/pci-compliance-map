All rights reserved.\n\nPage vi\nROC Template Instructions\nThis document, the PCI DSS v4.0 Report on Compliance Template (\u201cROC Template\u201d), is the mandatory template for Qualified Security\nAssessors (QSAs) completing a Report on Compliance (ROC) for assessments against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard\n(PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. The ROC Template provides the reporting instructions and template for QSAs to document\nPCI DSS assessments with the aim of ensuring a consistent level of reporting among assessors.\nUse of this ROC Template is mandatory for all PCI DSS v4.0 submissions.\nThe tables in this template may be modified to increase/decrease the number of rows or to change the column width. Additional appendices\nmay be added if the assessor feels there is relevant information to be included that is not addressed in the current format. However, the\nassessor must not remove any details from the tables provided in this document. Personalization, such as the addition of company logos to\nthe title page below, is acceptable.\nDo not delete any content from Part I or Part II of this document. The Instruction pages may be deleted; however, the assessor must follow\nthese instructions while documenting the assessment. The addition of text or rows is acceptable, within reason, as noted above. Refer to the\nPCI DSS v4.x Report on Compliance Template - Frequently Asked Questions document on the PCI SSC website for further guidance.\nThe ROC is completed during PCI DSS assessments as part of an entity\u2019s validation process. The ROC provides details about the entity\u2019s\nenvironment and assessment methodology and documents the entity\u2019s assessment results for each PCI DSS requirement. A PCI DSS\ncompliance assessment involves thorough testing and assessment activities, from which the assessor will generate evidence (assessment\nworkpapers). These workpapers contain comprehensive records of the assessment activities, including observations, results of system testing,\nconfiguration data, file lists, interview notes, documentation excerpts, references, screenshots, and other evidence collected during the\nassessment. The ROC is effectively a summary of evidence derived from the assessor\u2019s workpapers to document how the assessor\nperformed the validation activities and how the resultant findings were reached. At a high level, the ROC provides a comprehensive summary\nof testing activities performed and information collected during the assessment against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard\n(PCI DSS) Requirements and Testing Procedures. The information contained in a ROC must provide enough information and coverage to\nsupport the designated assessment findings.\nROC Sections\nThe ROC includes the following sections and appendices:\n\uf0a7"

Responses should be specific and relevant to\nthe assessed entity. Details provided should focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage and should avoid\ngeneric templated language.\nAssessor responses generally fall into categories, such as the following:\nReporting\nInstruction Term\nExample Usage\nDescription of Response\nIndicate\nIndicate whether the assessed entity is an issuer or\nsupports issuing services.\nThe response would be either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as shown:\n\u2610 Yes   \u2610 No\nNote: The applicability of some reporting instructions may be dependent on the\nresponse of a previous reporting instruction. If applicable, the reporting instruction\nwill direct the assessor to a subsequent instruction based on the yes/no answer.\nIdentify\nIdentify the evidence reference number(s) from\nSection 6 for all documentation examined for this\ntesting procedure.\nThe response would include the relevant item(s) requested.\nExample Reporting Instruction: \u201cIdentify the evidence reference number(s) from\nSection 6 for all documentation examined for this testing procedure.\u201d\nExample Response: Doc-01\nOR\nDoc-01 (Company XYZ Information Security Policy)\nNote: When a reference number is available, it is required; however, the\nassessor also has the option to list individual items in addition to the reference\nnumber.\nDescribe\nDescribe why the assessment finding was\nselected.\nThe response would include a detailed description of the item or activity in\nquestion \u2014 for example, details of how the evidence examined or individuals\ninterviewed demonstrate a requirement was met, or how the assessor concluded\na control implemented is fit-for-purpose. The response should be of sufficient\ndetail to provide the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the item or\nactivity being described.\nAttest\nIdentify the name of the QSA who attests.\nThe assessor\u2019s name is simply provided in the response. This \u201csignature\u201d adds\nmore weight than a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201ccheckmark\u201d response and is used when no\nadditional reporting is needed.\n\n\n\n\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1: ROC Template Instructions\n\nDecember 2022\n\u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

      "content": "Compensating Controls\nCompensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and\ndocumented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with not meeting the requirement through\nimplementation of other, or compensating, controls.\nCompensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:\n1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.\n2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that\nthe original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see the Customized\nApproach Objective for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not\nhave a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the Purpose in the Guidance column for that requirement.\n3. Be \u201cabove and beyond\u201d other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a\ncompensating control.)\n4. When evaluating \u201cabove and beyond\u201d for compensating controls, consider the following:\nNote: All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS assessment. The\neffectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is implemented, the surrounding\nsecurity controls, and the configuration of the control. Entities should be aware that a given compensating control will not be effective in all\nenvironments.\na. Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under\nreview. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting\ncleartext administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex\npasswords, etc.) to compensate for the lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk\nof interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review\n(passwords).\nb. Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area but are not\nrequired for the item under review.\nc. Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is\nunable to address a vulnerability that is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available from a\nvendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting\nnetwork access to the vulnerable interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS monitoring\nof all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface.\n5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement.\n\n\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1\n\nDecember 2022\n\u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nPage 465\n6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past\n(for example, where the performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).\nThe assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each\ncompensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.\nTo maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is\ncomplete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report\non Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable\nreport is submitted to the requesting organization.\n\n\nPCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template r1\n\nDecember 2022\n\u00a9 2006 - 2022 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.
